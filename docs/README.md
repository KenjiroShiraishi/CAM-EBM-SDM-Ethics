# Patient Understanding and Decision Aid Sheet

This document is designed to check how well patients understand their current condition and the information provided to them.

It serves two main purposes:
1. **Patient comprehension check:**  
   To confirm whether the patient accurately understands the biomedical explanation of their symptoms and treatment options.

2. **Decision aid support:**  
   By clarifying the patient’s level of understanding, this sheet helps facilitate shared decision making (SDM) and ensures any choice—whether to use CAM interventions, biomedical treatments, or both—is made with informed consent.

This approach supports transparency, patient autonomy, and minimizes misunderstanding, especially when introducing CAM within modern medical care.
