# üìù Patient Understanding and Shared Decision Support Sheet

This document is designed to support patient understanding and meaningful dialogue regarding their current condition and available care options.

## Purpose

This sheet serves two main purposes:

### 1. Comprehension Check
To confirm whether the patient understands the biomedical explanation of their symptoms and treatment pathways, including both conventional and complementary/alternative medicine (CAM) perspectives.

### 2. Dialogue Support for Decision-Making
While not a formal decision aid as defined by international standards (e.g., IPDAS), this sheet helps structure conversations around patient preferences, values, and informed consent.

It is especially useful when combining CAM and conventional medicine, where transparency and shared understanding are essential.

## Ethical Goals
This tool promotes:

- Transparency in clinical communication  
- Respect for patient autonomy  
- Culturally sensitive integration of CAM into modern care
