# CAM-EBM-SDM-Ethics

A simple framework for ethically integrating Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) into modern medical practice.  
This project emphasizes the balance of:

- **EBM (Evidence-Based Medicine)**
- **SDM (Shared Decision Making)**
- **Ethical accountability**

It also explores potential future applications in AI-driven clinical decision support.

## Patient Reflection and Treatment Planning Sheets (Jp/English)

This PDF contains two simple tools:

1. **Sheet for Setting Treatment Direction**  
   Helps patients clarify how they want to make decisions (individually, with family, or led by providers) and identify any concerns or hopes related to acupuncture and CAM.

2. **Sheet for Reviewing Current Condition**  
   Encourages patients to reflect on any positive or negative changes, questions about treatment, and overall goals for maintaining or improving their health.

These sheets support patient understanding, transparency, and communication in modern medical practice, especially when integrating CAM.

# CAM-EBM-SDM-Ethics

A simple framework for ethically integrating Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) into modern medical practice.

This project emphasizes the balance of:

- EBM (Evidence-Based Medicine)
- SDM (Shared Decision Making)
- Ethical accountability

and implements this balance in daily practice through the **EVA model**.

## EVA model (Evidence – Values – Accountability)

EVA is a minimal, practical structure for talking with patients about CAM as a **complement, not a substitute**, to standard care:

- **Evidence**  
  What is known and unknown about the benefits, risks, and limits of this CAM option  
  (including lack of direct evidence where applicable).

- **Values**  
  How the patient wishes to decide (alone, with family, or led by clinicians),  
  what they hope for, and what they want to avoid.

- **Accountability**  
  How the practitioner takes responsibility for:  
  - making safety boundaries explicit (what CAM will *not* do)  
  - encouraging timely medical consultation when needed  
  - documenting and revisiting decisions instead of “one-off consent”.

The questionnaires and checklists in this repository are designed to make EVA **visible, discussable, and auditable** in real-world CAM practice.

The framework is shared under a **CC BY 4.0 License**.  
Related files, diagrams, and protocols will be uploaded gradually, including:

- **EVA-based patient questionnaires**  
  - 1-minute survey immediately after the first visit  
  - 1–2 week follow-up survey

- **EVA clinician checklists**  
  - to structure explanation, shared decision making, and safety checks

- **Patient reflection and treatment planning sheets (JP/EN)**  
  - Sheet for setting treatment direction  
    - Helps patients clarify how they want to make decisions (individually, with family, or led by providers)  
      and identify any concerns or hopes related to acupuncture and CAM.  
  - Sheet for reviewing current condition  
    - Encourages patients to reflect on any positive or negative changes, questions about treatment,  
      and overall goals for maintaining or improving their health.

These tools support patient understanding, transparency, and communication in modern medical practice,  
especially when integrating CAM.

## AI and decision support

The EVA structure is also intended to be used in **AI-assisted clinical decision support**,  
by turning Evidence, Values, and Accountability into explicit fields in prompts and audit logs.
