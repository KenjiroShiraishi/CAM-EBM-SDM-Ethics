This project emphasizes the balance of:

- **EBM (Evidence-Based Medicine)**
- **SDM (Shared Decision Making)**

## Patient Reflection and Treatment Planning Sheets (Jp/English)

This PDF contains two simple tools:

1. **Sheet for Setting Treatment Direction**  
   Helps patients clarify how they want to make decisions (individually, with family, or led by providers) and identify any concerns or hopes related to acupuncture and CAM.

2. **Sheet for Reviewing Current Condition**  
   Encourages patients to reflect on any positive or negative changes, questions about treatment, and overall goals for maintaining or improving their health.

These sheets support patient understanding, transparency, and communication in modern medical practice, especially when integrating CAM.
